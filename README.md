# Blockchain Based E-voting Decentralized Application
This project is an attempt to create a robust, automated, secured E-voting System using Ethereum Blockchain technology.

# Why Ethereum?

Ethereum is a platform for Smart Contracts that provides the following:

* A public communication channel (i.e. its peer to peer network).
* All communication is authenticated (i.e. transactions are signed by the voter's Ethereum address)
* An immutable public ledger to store the voting information (i.e. eligibility white list, voting keys and votes).
* Economic majority must reach consensus on a program's execution.

## What is this project about?
This is a full stack web application(frontend + backend) + crossplatform mobile application(android & ios).

The architecture is somewhat similar to the well known old 2 tier "client-server" model where "server" is replaced by "distributed p2p platform". From the point of view of an application programmer it is client-server where the server is a local or remote Ethereum node exposing RPC interface.
