# Blockchain Based E-voting Decentralized Application
This project is an attempt to create a robust, automated, secured E-voting System using Ethereum Blockchain technology.

# Why Ethereum?

Ethereum is a platform for Smart Contracts that provides the following:

* A public communication channel (i.e. its peer to peer network).
* All communication is authenticated (i.e. transactions are signed by the voter's Ethereum address)
* An immutable public ledger to store the voting information (i.e. eligibility white list, voting keys and votes).
* Economic majority must reach consensus on a program's execution.

# How does it work?
